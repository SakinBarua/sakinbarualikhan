Place your profile photo named `creator.jpg` here to have it available as the author image and for social previews.

Recommended sizes:
- 1200x630 (best for Open Graph)
- 512x512 (app/icon)
- 192x192 (favicon fallback)

If you have an image called `creator.jpg`, copy it to this folder as `icons/creator.jpg`.

To convert SVG to PNG, use a tool like `inkscape` or `convert` (ImageMagick):

```bash
# ImageMagick example
convert icons/favicon.svg -background none -resize 512x512 icons/icon-512.png
```
